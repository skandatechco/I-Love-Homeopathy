I ❤️ Homeopathy (ILH) is Bahola’s flagship educational and engagement platform.
It demystifies homeopathy for the public, builds trust through compliance and expert review, and connects every reader to the Bahola ecosystem — Bahola.co (products & care), HomeopathyMasters / Skolapro (learning), RemedyFor (AI app), and Bahola PBR (research).

ILH blends tradition with evidence, guiding users from curiosity → education → consultation → research collaboration.
