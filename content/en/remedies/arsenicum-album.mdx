## Keynotes
- Burning pains described as “burning hot,” but the person still wants warmth applied.
- Marked restlessness: cannot settle, anxious, pacing, fears something is wrong.
- Extreme weakness and exhaustion out of proportion to how long they’ve been unwell.

## Typical scenario (traditional use)
- Vomiting + diarrhea from suspected bad food.
- Chilly, wants blankets, very thirsty but only for frequent tiny sips.
- Worried they might not recover.

## When to seek urgent care
If you have high fever that will not settle, signs of dehydration (very little urine, dizziness on standing), blood in stool, or breathing difficulty → seek immediate professional care.

## Supportive considerations
Small sips of clean water or ORS.
Rest.
Monitor temperature, hydration, mental status.
