## Green zone (monitor at home)
- Mild, familiar headache pattern.
- No fever, no injury, no neuro symptoms.
- Improves with rest, hydration, quiet.

## Amber zone (book a consult soon)
- New pattern you’ve never had before.
- Headache + sinus pressure, mild fever, recent cold.
- Headache triggered by screen strain, posture, dehydration.

## Red zone (urgent care now)
- Worst headache of your life.
- Sudden onset “like a thunderclap.”
- Headache after head injury or fall.
- Weakness, slurred speech, confusion, vision loss.

## Self-supportive steps
Low light, hydrate, rest neck/shoulders, check posture/eye strain.
Track triggers (sleep debt, dehydration, stress).

## Traditional homeopathic view (education only)
Some practitioners historically consider remedies like Belladonna for sudden throbbing, or Nux vomica for tension + irritability.
This is not medical advice or a promise of cure.
