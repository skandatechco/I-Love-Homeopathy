I ❤️ Homeopathy (ILH) is an initiative by Bahola to:
- Educate the public responsibly,
- Encourage safe decision-making (urgent vs monitor),
- Connect readers to qualified practitioners,
- Build a bridge between traditional practice and real-world evidence,
- And invite students and clinicians to join structured, ethical research.

We believe:
1. Education should reduce panic, not increase it.
2. Self-care should never delay real emergency care.
3. Transparency is non-negotiable.
4. Research matters.
